`@script`
In the previous section we saw how we can use a matrix inverse to solve a system of linear equations that has exactly one solution. In this section we will look at situations without perfect solutions and how we can use linear algebra to find the best approximation.

## Consistency

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "396d9564b5"
center_content: false
```

`@part1`
Two equations with two unknowns:

$$
\begin{array}{}
3x & - & y & = -1 \\\
0.5x &-& y & = -4 \\\
\end{array}
$$

Can be represented as a matrix-vector equation{{1}}

$$
\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
3 & -1 \\\
0.5 & -1
\end{array} } \right]
\left[ {\begin{array}{c}
x \\\
y
\end{array} } \right]
=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{c}
   -1 \\\
   -4
  \end{array} } \right]
$${{1}}

or{{1}}

$$
\textbf{A}\vec{x}=\vec{b}
$${{1}}


`@part2`
We can visualise this system as two intersecting lines{{2}}

![Graphical representation of consistent system of 2 equations with 2 unknowns ](https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/4435/datasets/d2ca724f690bc19d93d9f67203aff94240fae569/two_by_two_consistent.png){{2}}


`@script`
We have that given a system of two equations with two unknowns, {{1}} we can represent it as a matrix vector equation. {{2}} Graphically, we see two intersecting straight lines. 

However, this is only the case if the matrix A is invertible. We call a system like this consistent.

## Inconsistent systems

```yaml
type: "TwoRowsTwoColumns"
key: "06c9151650"
```

`@part1`
Two equations, two unknowns

`@part2`
Three equations, two unknowns

`@part3`
$$
\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
3 & -1 \\\
1.5 & -0.5
\end{array} } \right]
\left[ {\begin{array}{c}
x \\\
y
\end{array} } \right]
=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{c}
   -1 \\\
   -2.5
  \end{array} } \right]
$$


Note the bottom row is a constant multiple of the top row{{1}}


`@part4`
$$
\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
3 & -1 \\\
0.5 & -1 \\\
-1 & -1
\end{array} } \right]
\left[ {\begin{array}{c}
x \\\
y
\end{array} } \right]
=
  \left[ {\begin{array}{c}
   -1 \\\
   -4 \\\
   -5
  \end{array} } \right]
$$

Note there are more equations than unknowns. In this case we say that the system is _overdetermined_{{2}}
